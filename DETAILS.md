# System Requirements

## üü° Import an image into the program (BMP, PNG, JPG) 

‚ùå ~~Check the hex file signature to ensure the file is indeed an image~~ 

‚úî Program shall ensure that a valid image has been provided for input 

## ‚úî Import files into the program 

‚úî Ensure that the file isn‚Äôt too big to encode in the selected image 

‚úî Ensure that an image has been selected beforehand 

‚úî Program shall provide useful and context specific error messages 

## ‚úî Allow the user to choose between encoding and decoding files 

‚úî Select options using a drop down menu 

‚úî Encode and decode with every encoding method 

## ‚úî Display the encoding/decoding process 

‚úî Visual display for appropriate methods 

‚úî Progress bar 

## üü° Allow the user to choose between encoding steganography methods 

‚úî LSB (RGB Pixel Encoding) 

‚ùå ~~PVD (Pixel Value Differencing)~~ 

‚ùå ~~Noise Manipulation~~ 

‚úî Appending after the trailer hex (concatenation)

## ‚úî Export the encoded image 

‚úî Export the file to user-selected file name and directory 

# Test Plan

## Show the proper encoding and decoding of data
- A file will be encoded into an image file and decoded using both LSB and Concatenation methods.
- Through this test, most other test requirements should be met.

## Import images/files into the program
- This requirement will be met several times while testing the other requirements of the program.

## Allow the user to choose between encoding/decoding and steganography methods
- Display the combobox dropdown menus at the top of the program

## Display the encoding/decoding process 
- The middle window during the LSB encoding process should display a static-like image during the progress of encoding, showing which pixels are being altered.
- The progress bar should update with the progress of encoding/decoding during all methods.

## Export the encoded image 
- The encoded images will be exported in order to import them back into the program and show the decoding method.
